Grid namelist
=============

This namelist defines the resolution of the computations. Keep in mind that **MagIC** is a 3D pseudo-spectral spherical shell code using Chebyshev polynomial expansions in the radial and spherical harmonic expansions in the angular directions.

Outer Core
----------

.. _varn_r_max:

* **n_r_max** (default :f:var:`n_r_max=33 <n_r_max>`) is an integer which gives the number of grid points in the radial direction in the outer core (:math:`[r_i,r_o]`). If Chebyshev polynomials are used for the radial integration scheme, there are some constraints on the value of `n_r_max`: first of all it must be of the form ``4*n+1``, where ``n`` is an integer; and second the prime decomposition of `n_r_max-1` should only contain multiple of 3, 4 and 5 (this second condition comes from the limitations of the built-in discrete cosine transforms). This constraint is released when finite differences are used.

  .. note:: If Chebyshev polynomials are used, the possible values for :f:var:`n_r_max` below 220 are hence: 17, 21, 25, 33, 37, 41, 49, 61, 65, 73, 81, 97, 101, 109, 121, 129, 145, 161, 181, 193, 201, 217,...

* **n_cheb_max** (default :f:var:`n_cheb_max=31 <n_cheb_max>`) is an integer which is the number of terms in the Chebyshev polynomial expansion to be used in the radial direction - the highest degree of Chebyshev polynomial used being ``n_cheb_max-1``. Note that ``n_cheb_max <= n_r_max``. This quantity will not be used if finite differences are used.

.. note:: The horizontal resolution can be either specified in the physical space using `n_phi_tot`, the total number of azimuhtal grid points or by defining `l_max` and `m_max`. The different options are described below.

* **l_max** (default :f:var:`l_max=0 <l_max>`) is an integer which gives the maximum spherical harmonic degree. When `l_max /= 0`, the value of `n_phi_tot` in the input namelist is ignored and recomputed at the initialisation stage.

* **m_max** (default :f:var:`m_max=0 <m_max>`) is an integer which gives the maximum spherical harmonic order. It can be different from `l_max`.

* **m_min** (default :f:var:`m_min=0 <m_min>`) is an integer which gives the minimum spherical harmonic order. By default this is set to zero, if specified in combination with `m_max`, it implies that only azimuthal wavenumbers comprised between `m_min` and `m_max` will be considered. This is particularly useful when computing the onset of convection.

* **n_phi_tot** (default :f:var:`n_phi_tot=192 <n_phi_tot>`) is an integer which gives the number of longitudinal/azimuthal grid points. It has the following constraints:
 
  - :f:var:`n_phi_tot` must be a multiple of :f:var:`minc` (see below)

  - ``n_phi_tot/minc`` must be a multiple of 4

  - :f:var:`n_phi_tot` must be a multiple of 16

  .. note:: The possible values for :f:var:`n_phi_max` are thus: 16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 256, 288? 320, 384, 400, 512, 576, 640, 768, 864, 1024, 1280, 1536, 1792, 2048, ...

* **l_axi** (default :f:var:`l_axi=.false. <l_axi>`) is a logical. When set to true, one considers only the axisymmetric mode (i.e. MagIC becomes a 2-D axisymmetric code).

* **n_theta_axi** (default :f:var:`n_theta_axi=0 <n_theta_axi>`) is an integer which gives the number of latitudinal grid points when MagIC computes only the axisymmetric mode.

* **fd_order** (default :f:var:`fd_order=2 <fd_order>`) is an integer. This is the order of the finite difference scheme for the bulk points (possible values are 2, 4, 6).

* **fd_order_bound** (default :f:var:`fd_order_bound=2 <fd_order_bound>`) is an integer. This is the order of the finite difference scheme for the boundary points (possible values are 1,2,3,4,5,6, ...). This has to be smaller than the order of the scheme used for the bulk points.

* **fd_stretch** (default :f:var:`fd_stretch=0.3 <fd_stretch>`) is a real. It controls the ratio between the number of points in the boundary layers and in the bulk.

* **fd_ratio** (default :f:var:`fd_ratio=0.1 <fd_ratio>`) is a real. It controls the ratio between the smallest grid spacing and the largest grid spacing.  

  .. note:: When `fd_ratio` is set to 1, the radial grid is regularly-spaced.

* **l_var_l** (default :f:var:`l_var_l=.false. <l_var_l>`) is a logical. The spherical harmonic degree is a function of radius, when set to true. This practically reduces the number of spherical harmonic transforms in parts of the fluid domain but it comes at the price of an MPI inbalance. This feature is useful when computing full sphere geometry to avoid a too severe time step limitation close to the center. Right now the form of the radial dependence follows:

  .. math::
     \ell(r) = \max \left(1+\ell_{\hbox{max}}\sqrt{\frac{r}{\alpha_r r_o}},\ell_{\hbox{max}}\right)

  ..

In the above equation the parameter :math:`\alpha_r` is set to control the radius above which the truncation reaches :math:`\ell_{\hbox{max}}`. In the case of full spheres with :math:`r_o=1`, one directly has :math:`\ell(r)=\ell_{\hbox{max}}` for :math:`r>\alpha_r`.

This parameter can be directly controlled by the following entry in the input namelist:

* **rcut_l** (default :f:var:`rcut_l=0.1 <rcut_l>`) is a real. This corresponds to :math:`\alpha_r` in the above equation.


Inner Core
----------

* **n_r_ic_max** (default :f:var:`n_r_ic_max=17 <n_r_ic_max>`) is an integer which gives the number of grid points in the radial direction in the inner core (:math:`[0,r_i]`). It too, must be of the form ``4*n+1``, where ``n`` is an integer.

* **n_cheb_ic_max** (default :f:var:`n_cheb_ic_max=15 <n_cheb_ic_max>`) is the number of terms in the Chebyshev polynomial expansion in the radial direction in the inner core. Only Chebyshev polynomials of even degrees are used in the expansion giving the highest degree used to be ``2*n_cheb_ic_max-2``. Note that here too, ``n_cheb_ic_max <= n_r_max``.

Symmetry and aliasing
---------------------

.. _varMinc:

* **minc** (default :f:var:`minc=1 <minc>`) is an integer which gives the longitudinal symmetry. e.g: ``minc=n`` would give an n-fold rotational symmetry in the azimuthal direction. One can use this to reduce computational costs when the symmetry of the solution is known. The orders of the spherical harmonic expansion (``m``) are multiples of :f:var:`minc`.

* **nalias** (default :f:var:`nalias=20 <nalias>`) is an integer which determines antialiasing used in the spherical harmonic representation. Note that ``20 <= nalias <= 30``.


The number of grid points in latitude :f:var:`n_theta_max = n_phi_tot/2 <n_theta_max>`. The maximum degree (:f:var:`l_max`) and maximum order (:f:var:`m_max`) of the spherical harmonic expansion are determined by :f:var:`nalias`:

  .. code-block:: fortran

	l_max = (nalias * n_theta_max)/30
