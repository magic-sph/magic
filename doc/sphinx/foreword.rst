Introduction

Foreword
========

**MagIC** is a numerical code that can simulate fluid dynamics in a spherical
shell. MagIC solves for the Navier-Stokes equation including Coriolis force,
optionally coupled with an induction equation for Magneto-Hydro Dynamics (MHD),
a temperature (or entropy) equation and an equation for chemical composition
under both the anelastic and the Boussinesq approximations.

**MagIC** uses Chebyshev polynomials or finite difference in the radial direction and spherical
harmonic decomposition in the azimuthal and latitudinal directions. MagIC supports
several Implicit-Explicit time schemes where the nonlinear terms and the Coriolis force are treated explicitly, while the remaining linear terms are treated implicitly.

**MagIC** is written in Fortran and designed to be used on supercomputing
clusters.  It thus relies on a hybrid parallelisation scheme using both `OpenMP
<http://openmp.org/wp/>`_ and `MPI <http://www.open-mpi.org/>`_. Postprocessing
functions written in python (requiring `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
and `scipy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_) are also provided to allow a useful data
analysis.
