# Foreword

* **MagIC** is a numerical code that can simulate fluid dynamics in spherical geometry. MagIC solves for the Navier-Stokes equation including Coriolis force, optionally coupled with an induction equation for Magneto-Hydro Dynamics (MHD), a temperature (or entropy) equation and an equation for chemical composition under both the anelastic and the Boussinesq approximations.  

* **MagIC** uses either Chebyshev polynomials or finite differences in the radial direction and spherical harmonic decomposition in the azimuthal and latitudinal directions.  MagIC supports several Implicit-Explicit time schemes where the nonlinear terms and the Coriolis force are treated explicitly, while the remaining linear terms are treated implicitly.


* **MagIC** is written in Fortran and designed to be used on supercomputing clusters.  It thus relies on a hybrid parallelisation scheme using both [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/) and [MPI](http://www.open-mpi.org/). Postprocessing functions written in python (requiring [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) are also provided to allow a useful data analysis.  

* **MagIC** is a free software. It can be used, modified and redistributed under the terms of the [GNU GPL v3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).


# Quickly start using MagIC

## Docker

We provide a [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for a quick environment you can use magic! It 
comes with an ubuntu base, mpich (mpif90), and installs SHTns.

```bash
$ docker build -t magic .
```

Note that we build samples and run them (for testing) so the build takes a bit of time.
When it's done, let's now try interacting with the container. Note that the [entrypoint.sh](entrypoint.sh) script sources [sourceme.sh](sourceme.sh)
before executing your command, and thus will ensure the environment is ready.

```bash
# Ensure that the file is sourced
$ docker run --rm -it magic env | grep MAGIC_HOME
```
```console
MAGIC_HOME = </code>
MAGIC_HOME=/code
```

To shell inside and interact:

```bash
$ docker run -it magic bash
```

And the environment should be ready, e.g.,

```bash
cd /code/samples
./magic_wizard.py --use-mpi --nranks 4 --mpicmd mpiexec
```

And that's it! This container is also available via an automated build `ghcr.io/magic-sph/magic` if you want to
pull it directly. For a customized or local install, continue to the next section.

## Local Install

### 1) In order to check out the code, use the command

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/magic-sph/magic.git
```
or via SSH (it requires a public key):

```sh
$ git clone ssh://git@github.com/magic-sph/magic.git
```

### 2) Go to the root directory and source the environment variables (useful for python and auto-tests)

```sh
$ cd magic
```

If you are using sh, bash or zsh as default shell (`echo $SHELL`), just use the command

```sh
$ source sourceme.sh
```

If you are using csh or tcsh, then use the following command

```sh
$ source sourceme.csh
```

### 3) Install SHTns (recommended)

[SHTns](https://bitbucket.org/bputigny/shtns-magic) is a an open-source library for the Spherical Harmonics transforms. It is significantly faster than the native transforms implemented in MagIC, and it is hence **recommended** (though not mandatory) to install it. To install the library, first define a C compiler:

```sh
$ export CC=gcc
```
or

```sh
$ export CC=icc
```

Then make sure a FFT library such FFTW or the MKL is installed on the target machine. Then make use of the install script

```sh
$ cd $MAGIC_HOME/bin
$ ./install-shtns.sh
```

or install it manually after downloading and extracting the latest version [here](https://bitbucket.org/nschaeff/shtns/downloads/)

```sh
$ ./configure --enable-openmp --prefix=$HOME/local
```

if FFTW is used or

```sh
$ ./configure --enable-openmp --enable-ishioka --enable-magic-layout --prefix=$HOME/local --enable-mkl
```

if the MKL is used. Possible additional options may be required depending on the machine (check the website). Then compile and install the library

```sh
$ make
$ make install
```

### 4) Set up your compiler and compile the code


#### a) Using CMake (recommended)

Create a directory where the sources will be built

```sh
$ mkdir $MAGIC_HOME/build
$ cd $MAGIC_HOME/build
```
Set up your Fortran compiler

```sh
$ export FC=mpiifort
```
or

```sh
$ export FC=mpif90
```

Compile and produce the executable (options can be passed to cmake using `-DOPTION=value`)

```sh
$ cmake .. -DUSE_SHTNS=yes
$ make -j
```
The executable `magic.exe` has been produced!

#### b) Using make (backup solution)

Go to the source directory

```sh
$ cd $MAGIC_HOME/src
```

Edit the Makefile with your favourite editor and specify your compiler 
(intel, gnu, portland) and additional 
compiler options (SHTns, production run or not, debug mode, MKL library, ...)

```sh
$ make -j
```
The executable `magic.exe` has been produced!

### 5) Go to the samples directory and check that everything is fine

```sh
$ cd $MAGIC_HOME/samples
$ ./magic_wizard.py --use-mpi --nranks 4 --mpicmd mpiexec
```

If everything is correctly set, all auto-tests should pass!

### 6) You're ready for a production run

```sh
$ cd $SCRATCHDIR/run
$ cp $MAGIC_HOME/build/magic.exe .
$ cp $MAGIC_HOME/samples/hydro_bench_anel/input.nml .
```
    
Then change the input namelist to the setup you want and run the code:

```sh
$ export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
$ export KMP_AFFINITY=verbose,granularity=core,compact,1
$ mpiexec -n 4 ./magic.exe input.nml
```

### 7) Data visualisation and postprocessing

a) Set-up your PYTHON environment ([ipython](http://ipython.org/), [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) are needed)

b) Modify `magic.cfg` according to your machine in case the auto-configuration didn't work

```sh
$ vi $MAGIC_HOME/python/magic/magic.cfg
```

c) You can now import the python classes:

```python
python> from magic import *
```

and use them to read time series, graphic files, movies, ...

```python
python> ts = MagicTs(field='e_kin', all=True)
python> s = Surf()
python> s.equat(field='vr')
python> ...
```

### 8) Modify the code and submit your modifications

a) Before commiting your modifications **always** make sure that the auto-tests
pass correctly.

b) Try to follow the same coding style rules as in the rest of the code:

1. **Never** use TABS but always SPACES instead
2. Use 3 spaces for indentation
3. Never use capital letters for variable declaration or Fortran keywords
4. Never use `dimension(len)` for declaring array but rather `real(cp) :: data(len)`
5. Always use the default precisions when introducing new variables `(cp)`

More on that topic [here](http://www.fortran90.org/src/best-practices.html)

### 9) Make sure you cite the following papers if you intend to publish scientific results using MagIC:

* Boussinesq equations: [Wicht (2002, PEPI, 132, 281-302)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0031-9201(02)00078-X)

* In case you use the [SHTns](https://bitbucket.org/bputigny/shtns-magic) library for the spherical harmonics transforms (MagIC 5.3 or later), please also cite: [Schaeffer (2013, GGG, 14, 751-758)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ggge.20071)
